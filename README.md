# AppleMapsDemo
MapKit integration 

A simple demo of Apple maps integration in your project using MapKit.<br>
You can add locations to the app with their respective latitudes and longitudes. Each location will be added in a list once saved. When you click on any location from the list, the location is plotted on a map.<br>
The app also uses CoreData to retain the locations added.
